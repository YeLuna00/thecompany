''__Before Reporting An Issue:__''
Please read through the following notes before submitting an issue to the issue tracker. Thank you!

''__Missing Images__''
Please report if specific images are missing, including where you are in the game and what you were doing. If __all__ images are missing, please confirm that your game directory is correct. The game's html file should be in the same directory as the pics folder, but not IN the pics folder.

Every release is tested to confirm images are working in both the online and offline versions of the game, so it's very unlikely that a bug is causing all images to fail to load.

''__Save Issues__''
Unfortunately, there are many factors that go into how the Twine engine handles save files which cannot be managed or troubleshooted by me. Most of these problems are browser-related. Please do not report these issues, as they are not something I can fix. If your save files are disappearing or simply not saving to begin, try playing on a different browser, or keep your save files locally.

If your saves are not loading between major releases, this is intentional behavior. Any time a release updates major parts of the code or game structure, older saves are rendered invalid.

''__Spelling and Grammar__''
Reporting spelling and grammar issues is fantastic, please do this. When you do, please provide context as to where the issue is so I can locate it quickly.

''__Feature Requests__''
Please do not use the Report Issue function to make feature requests. Use the game's official discussion board at TFGS or on Patreon.
