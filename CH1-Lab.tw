''And just like that, everything and everyone that defined your last month had been shattered. You and $penny.name watched as suited executives, armed guards, and men in HAZMAT suits swarmed the building. All your notes and lab supplies were carefully packed and removed, and within minutes the room was spotless and empty. Afterwards, you would meet $penny.name in one of The Company's black SUVs used for transportation, and be taken to a private airstrip to relocate to their central HQ. You and $penny.name, as well as $julia.name would all be positioned in The Company's central medical division, now rebranded as R&D.

As time passed, you would come to learn what happened to your former coworkers. $diana.name held enough sway in The Company that she was simply relocated to another satellite branch.

	$tasha.name was put through The Company's training program, as expected, and sold internally.

	$tasha.name's newly altered mental start made her somewhat difficult to train, but she quickly found a place in The Company. She had been allowed to roam freely around the upper offices, offering herself to anyone who needed to relieve some stress.

	<<else>>\
		$john.name would have been kept around as a sales assistant, if not for the fact that she kept fucking her coworkers in the office. Eventually, it was decided to train her and sell her internally. She actually enjoyed the training so much that the training staff kept her around for several weeks before finally releasing her to auction.
	<</if>>\
<<else>>\
	<<if $john.isMale>>\
		After exposure to the BMB-1, $john.name's mental state was beyond repair, and beyond the ability to train in any capacity. Since he could no longer communicate, it was decided to sell him at a discount to a client looking for a male cumdumpster to entertain her guests with.

	$sophie.name was given to the Company VP as a gift and treated as his pet dog. He would walk her up and down the hallways on all fours, occasionally getting fucked in front of staff. When he was having a good day, he would make it open season on $sophie.name, allowing anyone with a spare minute to rape her as they pleased.
<<else>>\
	$sophie.name ultimately injected herself with the BMB-1, and ended up in a state too broken for The Company to rehabilitate. She lost her ability to speak beyond simple moans and gestures, and was eventually just sold at a discount to a client looking for an attractive, broken cumdumpster.

Your fates were ultimately no better than your former peers. Once the senior lab technicians learned all they could from you, and formulated their own transformative serum under $julia.name's supervision, you and $penny.name were reshaped into living sex dolls to be set up and used by the staff whenever they needed to get off. Not that it mattered much to you. The transformation dulled all your senses save for pleasure, and you eventually slipped into a deep, blissful coma...''

It's normal to have to get a little aggressive with the girls to get results around here, but, I've never seen anything like I did back then. Normally I'd stay out of the B1 level, where you and $penny.name work, always kinda gave me the creeps. Given everything that was going on at the time, though, I decided to go visit $julia.name, make sure she was alright. When I walked into her office, the girl I saw laying on that bed… It was a miracle she was even breathing, she looked like she'd been run over a truck! A few times! I mean, I'll be honest, I used to help the training team out from time to time, and I'd get a little violent, too, but this… It was like whoever did that to her was TRYING to kill her… Ever since then I've been trying to make it a point to stay off that floor...<</if>>">>\

''She hops up from her desk and walks over to where you are, reaching past you and pulling the door closed. As it clicks, while she's still not fully focused on you, you slip the needle into her neck. The effects aren't quite what you were expecting. Rather than her eyes lighting up and changing color, they become dull and noticeably vacant. You're not a hundred percent sure, but this is probably your window to get her to talk...''
